1. Derive a mask for the cloud which excludes infrared
emission not associated H i.

(a) Derive N (H i) given an H i width.

(b) Derive a MLE of the DGR and new H i width from Equation 5 given the model A
V,model = DGR × N (H i).

(c) Mask pixels with high residuals between A_V,data and A_V,model .

(d) Perform Steps 1a through 1c, using the H i width derived from Step 1b for
Step 1a until the H i width converges to a single value.  Masking pixels with
large residuals is complete.

2. Bin the image pixels to sizes where residuals are
not correlated, ∼ 1 ◦ .

3. Calculate likelihoods for the DGR and H i width using the binned image.

4. Estimate error of binned A_V pixels by calculating the variance in the
residuals from Step 3.

5. Calculate likelihoods for the DGR and H i width
using the binned image, and the new estimated
variance of the binned A_V pixels.

6. Use MLE H i width from Step 5 as the initial H i width in Step 1a. Repeat
Step 1a through 6 until the input H i width in Step 1a is similar as the MLE HI
width derived in Step 5.
